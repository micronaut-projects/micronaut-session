Micronaut provides this module inspired by https://projects.spring.io/spring-session/[Spring Session] that enables this which currently has two implementations:

* In-Memory sessions - which you should combine with a sticky session proxy if you plan to run multiple instances.
* Redis sessions - In this case https://redis.io[Redis] stores sessions, and non-blocking I/O is used to read/write sessions to Redis.
